# ... And you thought you were only learning about Web Programming!



# Physics, Computers and Math (Oh My!)

Computers are good at a few things:

1. repetative tasks
1. storing and retrieving data
1. performing calculations quickly
1. creating digital graphical displays that represent data

Notice that all of these points are important for web development, but they're ALSO important for making simulations ('computational models') of physical reality.

# Computers can be a 'time machine' of sorts

time machine; a machine capable of transporting a person backward or forward in time.

Javascript has a built-in feature that can be used to help with tracking and reacting to events at certain times: The Event Loop, used in asynchronous code.

# So... let us embark on the creation of a web app that can simulate a toy 'solar system'
